Keybert is a Python package for keyphrase extraction found in the library It is a keyword extraction tool that creates keywords and phrases by using a utilization tool called BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) BERT is a powerful language representation model that is compatible with single to multi-document processes. Keywords are embedded into a fixed-size vector from the range and is sorted through with BERT

You can customize a range from 1-3 words for the code to extract from that shows up as most relevant ( ex: word n-gram range = (1,3) | unigram (1), bigram (2), trigram (3) )

There are two methods:

Max Sum Similarity (MSS) extracts keywords that are the most relevant and the least similar
Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Minimizes redundancy and maximizes diversity in text summarization tasks.
Computes a cosine similarity between keyword embeddings and document embeddings. (compares the highest cosine similarity score) Displays the relevance of the results in each document provided

Not good for large documents and processing real-time results
