Purpose of the Milestone KeyBERT:
The milestone project we were tasked with involving KeyBERT and other keyword extraction tools such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)likely refers to a project or goal within SMX where the tool was implemented to achieve specific data processing or keyword extraction objectives. The purpose of this milestone project was to enhance data processing efficiency, improve the accuracy of information retrieval, and streamline the analysis of large datasets by automating the keyword extraction process. Comparing the multiple data extraction tools, KeyBERT was selected as the tool to accomplish these goals due to its simplicity, flexibility, and effectiveness in extracting relevant keywords from text data.

What is KeyBERT?
KeyBERT is a minimalistic and easy-to-use keyword extraction technique in Python that leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google. KeyBERT works by creating embeddings (numerical representations) of text and then extracting words or phrases that are most representative of the content of the document. It identifies the most relevant keywords or key phrases within a given piece of text by finding those that have the highest cosine similarity with the document's overall embedding.

Usefulness of KeyBERT:
KeyBERT is particularly useful for tasks that involve large volumes of unstructured text data, such as research papers, articles, or customer feedback. Some key benefits of using KeyBERT include:

-  Automation of Keyword Extraction: KeyBERT automates the process of identifying the most important terms in a document, saving time and reducing the need for manual keyword extraction.

-  Improved Accuracy: By leveraging BERTâ€™s advanced language understanding capabilities, KeyBERT can extract more accurate and contextually relevant keywords compared to traditional methods.

-  Efficiency in Data Processing: KeyBERT can handle large datasets efficiently, making it an ideal tool for processing high volumes of text data quickly.

-  Enhanced Data Analysis: The extracted keywords can be used to categorize, index, or summarize documents, aiding in data analysis and making it easier to retrieve relevant information.

-  Customizable and Flexible: Users can fine-tune the keyword extraction process by adjusting parameters or integrating KeyBERT with other NLP tools, making it adaptable to various use cases.
